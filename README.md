This Project is collecting my journey for an own chess engine

Components:
    
- *Mailbox based MoveGenerator*
  The version implemented is working flawlessly but it sucks at perft
- *Bitboard based MoveGenerator*
  Works perfectly, tested with many perft challenges like kiwipete and performs well
- *Stockfish NNU -AI scoring engine*
  Java Port of the NNUE Probe Neuronal Network project from Daniel Shawul
  Works nicely but to date implemented with depth 2
- *UCI Client*
  to use engine in Chess Arena (ApeMind)
